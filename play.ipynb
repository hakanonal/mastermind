    "To learn the game rules please follow [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) link.\n",

    "You can configure the game rules by changing the chances, digits and peg_count parameters below. Ignore the other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- chances: Number of maximum guesses. The default is 12 which means you can guess 12 code to win. If you can not guess all 12 codes you loose. You can decrease this value to make it harder.\n",
    "- digits: Length of each code. The default is 4\n",
    "- peg_count: Number of avaible different pegs. Detault is 6. \n",
