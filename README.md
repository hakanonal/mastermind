- I have read the game rules from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
- Checked some python already made implementaions like [this](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/create-mastermind-game-in-python) and [this](https://bnbasilio.medium.com/mastermind-a-how-to-in-python-7b80ca9809ab)
- Created a this github repository. 
- Copied my agent/environment code template from my other projects.
- Prepeared the template to start coding accordinglly for the game.
- Well! I have went though my template. I need to figure out:
    - the q-table struture (I may decide to use a neural net. I do not know how to choose right now)
    - code the game rules
    - figure out metrics.
    - print the board
    - add user input functionallty.
- So curentlly the code is not working. Work is in progess...
- [This](https://bnbasilio.medium.com/mastermind-a-how-to-in-python-7b80ca9809ab) article has a good algorithm to find the feedback array check provideFeedback method in the article.
